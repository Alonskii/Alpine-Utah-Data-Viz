# Alpine-Utah-Data-Viz

Visualization done by me with the data downloaded from the https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ 

This is a data visualization of the temperature high and low of Alpine between June 2017, and May 2022. 

The file 'data_headers.py' should be run first to generate the header rows of our data for clarity, so that we can get the accurate index positions of data information that we need to work with, this should be done to avoid unintentional mistake.

When you run the program, you'll discover that only one date had a missing data, because the error was handled appropriately, our code wass able to generate a plot which skips over the missing data.

I used the fill_between() method, which takes a series of x-values and two series of y-values, and fills the space between the two y-value series to show the range between the high and low temperatures.

The alpha argument, controls a colorâ€™s transparency. By setting alpha to 0.5, we make the red and blue plot lines appear lighter.
